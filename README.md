# Grid Impact Visualization Tool (GIVT)
This tool aims to give the user insight of the impact electric devices have on the local grid. This is done by allowing them to interact with parameters and see the reponse in both the graph(s) and neighborhood. 

The code is run by running `main.py` after installing required packages as found in `requiremens.txt`.
